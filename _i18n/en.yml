    paragraphs:
      line1: "Masari is a privacy-centric innovative cryptocurrency that allows users to send money around the globe with low fees very quickly."
      line2: "Masari ($MSR) is a proof of work peer-to-peer internet currency using the well researched and cryptographically sound <a href='https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf' target='_blank'>CryptoNote</a> and <a href='https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf' target='_blank'>RingCT</a> protocols. This means that every transaction origin, amount, and destination is obfuscated by default."
      line3: "Masari is an open source project that is fully decentralized, similar to bitcoin. With several CryptoNote firsts such as uncle mining via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/secor/secor.pdf' target='_blank'>SECOR protocol</a>, a <a href='https://masariwallet.com' target='_blank'>fully client side web wallet</a>, and PoW sharding via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/blocktree/blocktree.pdf' target=''>blocktree protocol</a>, Masari is a fast, fungible, secure, private and soon-to-be scalable currency."

about:
  paragraph_1: "Masari (MSR) is a proof of work (PoW) peer-to-peer internet currency using the well researched and cryptographically sound <a href='https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf' target='_blank'>RingCT</a> and <a href='https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf' target='_blank'>CryptoNote</a> protocols. This means that every transaction origin, amount, and destination is obfuscated by default. Masari is an open source project that is fully decentralized without any central authorities, similar to bitcoin. With several CryptoNote firsts such as uncle mining via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/secor/secor.pdf' target='_blank'>SECOR protocol</a>, a <a href='https://www.masariwallet.com' target='_blank'>fully client side web wallet</a>, and PoW sharding via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/blocktree/blocktree.pdf' target='_blank'>blocktree protocol</a>, Masari is a fast, fungible, secure, private and soon-to-be efficiently scalable currency."
  paragraph_2: "With ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses, every transaction origin, amount, and destination is untraceable and unlinkable. Transactions on the Masari blockchain cannot be linked to a particular user or real-world identity."
  paragraph_3: "Private by default, Masari is a fungible form of currency.  Vendors and exchanges are unable to blacklist units of Masari from previous transaction associations."
  paragraph_4: "Uncle mining (SECOR protocol) securely reduces block time to 60 seconds, unlike the common 120 seconds present in most CryptoNote coins. Combined with low fees, your funds will be sent and received quickly and at a fraction of the cost."
  paragraph_5: "Masari created the first iteration of what is now the LWMA difficulty algorithm. Masari uses an improved LWMA as our difficulty algorithm to address the issue of flash mining and slow difficulty adjustments in order to keep mining profitable and our network secure."
  paragraph_6: "In addition to reducing block time, our SECOR protocol also helps to add more 'weight' to the blockchain by rewarding miners who solve <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/orphan-block-cryptocurrency.asp' target='_blank'>orphan blocks</a>, further securing the network and providing additional protection against chainsplits."
  paragraph_7: "Our <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/masari-webwallet' target='_blank'>web wallet</a> is also fully client side, meaning you can safely and effectively spend your money anywhere and anytime."
  paragraph_8: "Currently, CryptoNote coins are unable to scale efficiently due to the inherent default privacy features taking up a big portion of every transaction’s size. Masari’s solution to this problem is blocktree, a method which increases transaction throughput by allowing multiple blocks to be mined in parallel. Utilizing this protocol, the network will be able to retain efficiency under heavier loads as Masari is further supported and used. Blocktree is currently in the works."
